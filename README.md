The login page:

![activity5-1](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/40cb5f75-2054-46dc-9013-6eada87418ad)

<br>

As an ADMIN , he can check all products, modify, and delete each of them:

![A5-2](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/203bf024-c5ff-4e70-82b8-dbdfb8b89d78)

<br>

To create a product, we get this message:

![A5-3](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/31fd4e58-caf2-40e7-a080-4733e1c0a81c)

JWT created for user1 with role USER

![A5-4](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/add15afd-d7d1-4484-a1d7-5560019c821a)

<br>

As a USER, he can only see the products:

![A5-5](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/21fac332-0879-4279-a048-a3ef6d9fb910)

<br>

Once the **'USER'** is trying to create a product, he gets this **"notAuthorized"** page:

![A5-6](https://github.com/YasminaElhassani/Activity5-angular-json-server/assets/103280152/ccfb41d4-ddf1-4ae7-8450-2b8b9700b00c)
