The login page:

<br>

As an ADMIN , he can check all products, modify, and delete each of them:

![Admin Products](captures/admin-products.jpg)

<br>

To create a product, we get this message:

![Create Product](captures/save-product.jpg)

<br>


JWT created for user1 with role USER

![User JWT](captures/user-jwt.jpg)

<br>

As a USER, he can only see the products:

![User Products](captures/user-show.jpg)

<br>

Once the **'USER'** is trying to create a product, he gets this **"notAuthorized"** page:

![Not Authorized](captures/not-authorized.jpg)
